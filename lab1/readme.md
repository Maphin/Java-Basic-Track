# LAB 1
My serial number in the group list - 13

## Manipulations with matrices
C5: 13 % 5 = 3
C5 - bitwise exception xor

## Matrices elements type
C7: 13 % 7 = 6
C7 - float

## Manipulation with final matrix
C11: 13 % 11 = 2
C11 - calculate the sum of the biggest elements of each raw of the matrix

## Additional info
Seeing as 'bitwise xor' is impossible to be done with float numbers (even using Float.floatToIntBits), I decided to round float numbers and then do bitwise xor
